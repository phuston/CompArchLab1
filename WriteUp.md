1. Implementation

	In the process of implementing our ALU, we made several interesting design choices to improve efficiency, speed, and decrease the area of the unit.

	- Interesting choices

	![A block diagram of our ALU's main components][ALUDiagram.png]
	- Block diagrams of all ALU components.

2. Test Results

	- AND, NAND Test Bench Results

	- OR, NOR Test Bench Results

	- ADD, SUB Test Bench Results

	- SLT Test Bench Results


3. Timing Analysis

	- AND

	- NAND

	- OR

	- NOR

	- XOR

	- ADD

	- SUB

	- SLT


4. Work Plan Relection

	- Include our work_plan.txt probably, and how that turned out, what took longer than expected, what took shorter than expected



TODO:

	- Write test benches

		> OR, NOR, XOR
		> ADD, SUB
		> SLT
	- Analyze propagation delays
		> AND, NAND
		> OR, NOR, XOR
		> SLT
	- Create block diagram of ALU
